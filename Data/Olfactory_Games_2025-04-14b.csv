Gameplay blends dice-rolling movement, scent identification, and mini-challenges. Landing on ""smell spots"" prompts players to draw from a scent deck and perform a task; correct guesses allow extra movement, while wrong ones stall the turn. ""Special squares"" add bonuses or penalties like mazes, skunk sprays (lose a turn), or shortcuts.

Each raspberry imparts a sharp, delayed burn (from Tabasco) after initial sweetness, helping players identify it as the ""suspicious"" element. This structure allows for taste-based storytelling, where participants deduce who received which fruits in which course to trace the traitor.

The game unfolds over three Japanese-inspired courses and a dessert, each paired with a poetic riddle and a challenge... (1) Course One: Gyoza (Fried Dumplings) - Each player receives two standard dumplings and one secretly spiked with wasabi. Players must maintain composure while eating. If anyone reacts too strongly, the course is removed for everyone. This course tests physical tolerance and introduces the clue “ONE”, referring to the number of spicy dumplings. (2) Course Two: Tofu Miso Soup - Players eat blindfolded, relying on taste and texture to identify ingredients. Clues (“A”, “L”, “L”, and “–U”) are hidden beneath bowls. Players must determine how many tofu cubes they consumed (“FOUR”) using only mouthfeel. Together, these elements eventually lead to the phrases “ALL FOR ONE” and “ONE FOR ALL”. (3) Course Three: Tekkadon (Tuna Rice Bowl) - One randomly chosen player receives a hidden raspberry in their dish: the “mark of the crown.” Another player gains “ace” status by finishing first, earning the power to make a critical final decision. (4) Dessert: Fruit Gelatin - The ace chooses between “ALL FOR ONE” (share the dessert) or “ONE FOR ALL” (claim the crown alone).

You Better Eat to Survive,,2018,Mixed,,,,"Peter Arnold, Rohit Ashok Khot, Florian Mueller",,"""You Better Eat to Survive"" is a two-player virtual reality game where one player is immersed in a VR survival environment and the other remains in the real world, helping their partner survive by feeding them real food. The VR player is stranded on a virtual island and must explore to find and activate a flare gun, but they periodically lose vision (a blackout phase) unless they eat. Eating restores vision. The twist is that the VR player can't see the food due to the headset, so the second player must physically feed them. Players must coordinate closely: one navigates and performs in VR, while the other monitors food supply and timing in the real world.","Eating, Buffing",Partner,TRUE,2,2,1,,,,Low,Needs to be edible food.,Fully Flexible,,,,,,,Research,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173225.3173238,Human,,,,,,,YouBetterEatToSurvive_2018,
