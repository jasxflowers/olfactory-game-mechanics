The Illusory Feast spell conjures the appearance of a target’s favorite food, causing non-combatants to drop what they’re doing to indulge and distracting those already engaged in battle. In the Tyranny of Dragons module, players can use slabs of meat to divert ambush drakes in the Cult of the Dragon's camp, with a nearby butchery providing a convenient source of bait.",,,,,"Dragons are often distinguished by their unique scents, with good-aligned metallic dragons carrying pleasant aromas and evil-aligned chromatic dragons exuding harsher, more unpleasant odors. Brass dragons have a sandy scent, bronze dragons smell of sea spray, copper dragons carry a stony aroma, gold dragons are fragrant with saffron and incense, and silver dragons have the fresh scent of rain. In contrast, black dragons reek of rot and stagnant water, blue dragons carry the sharp scent of ozone and sand, green dragons emit a stinging chlorine-like odor, red dragons smell of sulfur and pumice, and white dragons have a crisp, faintly chemical scent.",,"The Inventor Kobold has an action called Skunk in a Cage, in which it releases a live skunk onto the battlefield. The skunk then randomly sprays a nearby creature, and if the target fails its saving throw, the overwhelming stench renders it too repulsed to act temporarily.","In the Fifth Edition, identifying an unknown magic potion has been simplified: any character can determine its effects by tasting a small sample, bypassing the need for spells or elaborate rituals.","The Stinking Cloud spell fills an area with a noxious, choking fog that incapacitates creatures inside, leaving them helpless with nausea. Affected targets remain nauseated for as long as they remain in the cloud and for up to five minutes after exiting.","Many creatures possess an exceptional sense of smell, represented either by bonuses to Perception checks for scent-based detection or the Scent special ability, which allows them to detect hidden creatures and track by smell. Dragons have extraordinary olfactory senses, with one in the Forgotten Realms supplement Cult of the Dragon claiming it can smell human fear. Grimlocks, who are blind and dwell in dark caves, rely on their heightened senses of smell and hearing to hunt. Gnomes, though not as keen as creatures with the Scent ability, have a more refined sense of smell than other Player's Handbook races, which allows gnome alchemists to track chemical reactions by odor. Kobolds have exploited this trait by creating the Gnome Blight spell, which conjures a cloud of arcane pollen that is particularly debilitating to creatures with sensitive noses. ","Many animals and certain monstrous humanoids possess the Scent ability, which grants them a +4 bonus to tracking checks if they can pick up a trail. Tracking is based on the creature’s Survival skill, and since most creatures with Scent have high Survival scores, they excel at following targets by smell. Avoiding detection by scent is difficult, with crossing a body of water being one of the few reliable ways to break a trail.","The Stinking Cloud spell conjures a foul-smelling fog that nauseates creatures who fail their saving throws. Various creatures also possess natural odor-based attacks, such as Troglodytes, which emit a nauseating stench that affects nearby enemies, though the exact mechanics vary between editions. Similarly, Ghasts, a more powerful form of ghouls, exude a rotting stench that sickens any living beings that come too close.",
